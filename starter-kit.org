* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
  :END:

The Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences is maintained by [[http://kieranhealy.org][Kieran
Healy]]. The original version was written by [[http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree][Phil Hagelberg]]. This
version is more directly descended from [[http://eschulte.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/][Eric Schulte's]] excellent
org-mode implementation. It is designed specifically for [[http://emacsformacosx.com/builds][GNU Emacs 24
on Mac OS X]]. It may well work on Windows, but I don't promise that. It
is not compatible with [[http://aquamacs.org][Aquamacs]].

The goal of this kit is to provide a more useful set of defaults than
you get normally with Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but provides
a good set of defaults for all levels of users. This particular
version of the kit includes settings and packages that are
particularly useful for researchers in the social sciences.

The main advantage of this Emacs Starter Kit are
- better default settings
- inclusion of many useful libraries
- "literate" customization embedded in Org-mode files
- an organizational directory structure
- git provides for version control, backup, and sharing

The latest version is at
[[http://kjhealy.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/]]. 

** Learning
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: learning
   :END:

This won't teach you Emacs, but it'll make it easier to get
comfortable. To access the tutorial, press control-h followed by t.

The [[http://emacswiki.org][Emacs Wiki]] is also very handy.

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installation
   :END:
Installation instructions for the social-science version of the kit
can also be found at [[http://kjhealy.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/]]

1. - Install Mac OS X's suite of Developer Tools. These came with your
   Mac on an install DVD of their own. Alternatively, [[http://developer.apple.com/downloads][download the
   most recent version]] from Apple directly. You can choose either the
   full Xcode installation or the (much smaller) command-line tools
   for Xcode.
   - Install Git. Either compile it from source if you know what
     you're doing or [[http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can%3D3][install it directly]].
   - Install [[http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/][TeX]]. 
   - Note your user name or the name of your computer. If you don't
     know either, open the Terminal.app and do one or both of =whoami=
     or =hostname=. You will need to know your login name to activate
     the final customization file properly. You can use the system
     name as well (or instead) but it's optional.
   - Install Emacs (version 24 is required) Use your package manager
     if you have one.  Otherwise, Mac users should get it [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][from here]],
     or install it directly from [[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/][from source]] following the
     instructions in =nextstep/INSTALL=. Be sure to download a version
     of Emacs 24, which is currently in pretest release but very
     stable---[[http://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-pretest-24.0.95-universal-10.6.8.dmg][here is a link to the most recent pretest for OS X]].
     Windows users can get it [[http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-22.3-bin-i386.zip][from GNU]].
   - If they're already present, back up your =.emacs= file and backup 
     your =~/.emacs.d/= directory somewhere else. Delete the =.emacs=
     file and reove the =~/.emacs.d/= directory. (See below for details
     on where to put any existing customizations you wish to keep.) Move
     the resulting directory to =~/.emacs.d=.
2. Checkout a version of the starter kit using git -- if you're new to
   git checkout this [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html][git-tutorial]], also we'd highly recommend that you
   try out [[http://zagadka.vm.bytemark.co.uk/magit/magit.html][magit]] the Emacs mode for git interaction which comes
   bundled in the starter kit.
   #+begin_src sh
     git clone http://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_src
3. Pull in some [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#submodules][submodules]] with the following
   #+begin_src sh
   cd ~/.emacs.d/
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   #+end_src
4. Finally, change the name of the starter kit's =kjhealy.org= to that
   of =<USERNAME>.org= or =<SYSTEMNAME>.org=, based on the information
   you noted above with the =whoami= and =hostname= commands. These
   files are where you can add in any of your own existing or future
   customizations without breaking the starter kit's overall
   setup. See the =kjhealy.org= file for more information on further
   changes you need to make within that file, e.g., so that it points
   to your LaTeX =.bib= files properly, etc.
5. Launch Emacs!

After setup you may need to restart Emacs a couple of times while it
downloads and installs packages from [[* Emacs Lisp Package Archive][ELPA]].

Once everything starts up cleanly, if you wish you can do =M-x
starter-kit-compile= to byte-compile the starter kit files (for
slightly faster loading).

If you want to keep your regular ~/.emacs.d in place and just launch a
single instance using the starter kit, try the following invocation:

#+begin_src sh
  emacs -q -l ~/src/emacs-starter-kit/init.el
#+end_src

Note that having a ~/.emacs file might override the starter kit
loading, so if you've having trouble loading it, make sure that file
is not present.

** Structure
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: structure
   :END:

The init.el file is where everything begins. It's the first file to
get loaded. Additional customization embedded in this file provides
what I consider to be better defaults, both for different programming
languages and for built-in Emacs features like bindings or registers.

The Starter Kit makes use of Emacs 24's new package system to install
a number of additional packages. These are stored in
=~/.emacs.d/elpa=. Some useful packages are not available through the
package manager yet. These are stored in =~/.emacs.d/src/=.

There are also a few files that are meant for code that doesn't belong
in the Starter Kit, they are described below in [[* customization][Customization]].

** Customization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: customization
   :END:

The many defaults built into the starter kit are only the beginning of
most users customization of Emacs to suite their needs.  The starter
kit provides a number of places for additional user and system
specific customization.  These are designed in such a way that it will
be easy for you to continue tracking your own personal customization
inside the starter-kit while retaining your ability to pull down
general starter-kit updates without conflict.

- Make your own branch :: The first step to user-specific
     customization is (like in any git project) to make a branch for
     your local changes using =git branch=.  Save the master branch
     for pulling down new versions of the starter kit, and save all of
     your personal information in a personal branch.  That way you
     never have to worry about accidentally =git push='ing up a patch
     with all of your gnus email passwords.

- User specific config :: Your personal configuration information can
     be stored in a user-specific-config file.  This is the file named
     after your user with the extensions =.el= or =.org= [2].  If
     you're unsure of your user name evaluate the following code block
     to find out.
     #+begin_src sh
       echo $USER
     #+end_src
       
     If your configuration starts to feel cramped in a single file
     (although with the nested headlines of an Org-mode file, that
     could take a while) and you want to stretch your config's legs,
     you can also create a directory named after your system user
     name.  If a such a directory exists, it will be added to the
     load-path, and any elisp or org-mode w/embedded elisp files in it
     will be loaded.

- System specific config :: Finally, you may want to configure
     different settings for different machines.  The Starter Kit will
     look for a file named after the current hostname ending in =.el=
     or =.org= which will allow host-specific configuration.  If
     you're unsure of your hostname the following can be executed to
     find out.
     #+begin_src sh
       hostname
     #+end_src

- Installing more elisp libraries :: While the starter kit include
     many useful Emacs lisp libraries, you are bound to find more that
     you will want to install.  The easiest way to install new
     libraries is through the Emacs Lisp Package Archive (see [[* elpa][ELPA]]).
     When a library is not available through ELPA you can grab its
     source and place it directly in the =src= directory.  Any
     packages found there will automatically be added to your
     load-path when Emacs starts up.
     
Some additional miscellaneous configuration and getting started
suggestions
- First off see the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html#Customization][Customization]] node in the Emacs manual.  Available
  online or through the =info= command (run with =C-h i=).
- =grep=-ing through the =starter-kit-*= files in this directory can
  provide useful examples for how to do things like install major
  modes, define keybindings, etc..
- read the following [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp/html_node/Key-Binding-Conventions.html][Key-Binding-Conventions]] before defining too many
  personal key bindings
- The starter-kit comes pre-bundled with a variety of color themes.
  See [[file:starter-kit-misc.org::*Color%20Themes][Color Themes]] for instructions on how to change the colors used
  by Emacs.

** Emacs Lisp Package Archive
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: elpa
   :END:

Libraries from [[http://tromey.com/elpa][ELPA]] are preferred when available since dependencies
are handled automatically, and the burden to update them is removed
from the user. 

Sometimes packages are removed from the Starter Kit as they get added
to ELPA itself. This has occasionally caused problems with certain
packages. If you run into problems with such a package, try removing
everything from inside the elpa/ directory and invoking M-x
starter-kit-elpa-install in a fresh instance.

** Contributing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: contributing
   :END:

If you know your way around Emacs, please try out the starter kit as a
replacement for your regular dotfiles for a while. If there's anything
you just can't live without, add it or let me know so I can add
it. Take a look at what happens in [[file:init.el][init.el]] to get started.

Also: see the [[* Tasks][Tasks section]] in this document. Helping submit new
libraries to ELPA is the easiest way to help out. There are two ways
you can do this: either take new libraries and make them ready for
ELPA, dropping them in the elpa-to-submit directory or take files that
are already in elpa-to-submit, ensuring all their dependencies are
correctly loaded into ELPA, and sending them to the ELPA
maintainer. There are details at http://tromey.com/elpa/upload.html
for how ELPA submission works. Grep the project for TODO for other
things.

This section contains all code implementing the Emacs Starter Kit.

** Starter kit basics

*** Load path etc.

#+srcname: starter-kit-load-paths
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (setq dotfiles-dir (file-name-directory
                      (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))))
  
  (add-to-list 'load-path dotfiles-dir)
  (setq autoload-file (concat dotfiles-dir "loaddefs.el"))
  (setq package-user-dir (concat dotfiles-dir "elpa"))
  (setq custom-file (concat dotfiles-dir "custom.el"))
#+end_src

*** Ubiquitous Packages

These should be loaded on startup rather than autoloaded on demand
since they are likely to be used in every session

#+srcname: starter-kit-load-on-startup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (require 'cl)
  (require 'saveplace)
  (require 'ffap)
  (require 'uniquify)

*** Starter Kit aspell
aspell workaround in [[file:starter-kit-aspell.org][starter-kit-aspell]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (starter-kit-load "starter-kit-aspell.org")
#+end_src

*** ELPA (Emacs Lisp Package Manager)
Load up [[http://tromey.com/elpa/][ELPA]], the Emacs Lisp package manager.

#+srcname: starter-kit-elpa
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (require 'package)
;;  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("original" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/"))

  (package-initialize)
  (starter-kit-load "starter-kit-elpa.org")
#+end_src

#+results: starter-kit-elpa
: loaded starter-kit-elpa.el

*** Work around OS X bug

Work around a bug on OS X where system-name is FQDN
#+srcname: starter-kit-osX-workaround
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
      (setq system-name (car (split-string system-name "\\."))))
#+end_src

*** System/User specific customizations

You can keep system- or user-specific customizations here in either
raw emacs-lisp files or as embedded elisp in org-mode files (as done
in this document).

#+srcname: starter-kit-user/system-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (setq system-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir system-name ".el")
        system-specific-literate-config (concat dotfiles-dir system-name ".org")
        user-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir user-login-name ".el")
        user-specific-literate-config (concat dotfiles-dir user-login-name ".org")
        user-specific-dir (concat dotfiles-dir user-login-name))
  (add-to-list 'load-path user-specific-dir)
#+end_src

You can keep elisp source in the =src= directory.  Packages loaded
from here will override those installed by ELPA.  This is useful if
you want to track the development versions of a project, or if a
project is not in elpa.

#+srcname: starter-kit-load-elisp-dir
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq elisp-source-dir (concat dotfiles-dir "src"))
(add-to-list 'load-path elisp-source-dir)
#+end_src

* FAQ
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
Frequently asked questions.

Please share anything that you have come across which you think could
be helpful, either in the form of a pull request, a patch, or just an
email to me http://github.com/eschulte.

** How do I use the starter kit without compiling org-mode?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: no-compile
:END:
Some users wish to run org-mode straight from the sources, since the
compiled source can make reading backtraces difficult. Whatever your
reason may be, you use the starter kit this way.

Skip the =make= step in the <<Installation>> section. Instead, follow
these instructions.

1) =org-install.el= is required by the starter kit. To make it,
   navigate to the =src/org= directory and enter =make
   lisp/org-install.el= at the command prompt.
2) Updating the documentation is probably a good idea. Enter =make
   info=. Optionally, you can update the system-wide org documentation
   by entering =make install-info=. If you want a PDF version of the
   manual, you can enter =make doc/org.pdf= and find the resulting
   file in the doc directory.

** I recently updated the starter kit, but org is an old version. How do I fix this? 
Doing a =git pull= and =git submodule update= will not be
enough. Go to the =src/org= directory and enter =make clean= to get
rid of the old version. Then, enter =make=, or follow the
[[#no-compile][alternate instructions]].

** I changed my personal init file, =username.org=, but the starter kit didn't pick up the changes. What do I do now?
Some users may find it useful to remove the tangled version of init
files. If you find a particular file is not loading as expected,
remove the elisp version of that file and restart Emacs.

For example, if your $USER is "johndoe", you could issue =rm
johndoe.el= to remove the tangled output from the previous time
=johndoe.org= was loaded by org-babel.

Under no circumstances should you issue =rm *.el=! This will remove
the =init.el= file, which is perhaps the most crucial startup file in
the starter kit. Use some regexp magic if you want to remove all elisp
files except this one. For example, this works nicely:

#+begin_src shell-script
  rm starter-kit*.el
#+end_src

** Hey! The org info manual isn't showing up in emacs. What gives?
Sometimes, info manuals can be a real headache, but some users prefer
them. If the org info manual isn't showing up, or the info manual is
displaying the wrong version of the org-mode documentation (Emacs
ships with an older version of org-mode than the one the starter kit
uses), the problem most likely resides in your local setup.

1) The shell's $INFOPATH variable
   Have you set the shell's INFOPATH variable? The starter kit should
   not be ignoring this variable. This variable is copied into the
   elisp variable =Info-default-directory-list= when emacs starts
   up. The starter kit then copies =Info-default-directory-list= to
   =Info-directory-list= without losing any changes you may have made
   to this variable. This is the next place to look.
2) =Info-directory-list=
   Is the doc directory for the starter kit version of org-mode at the
   top of this list? If not, open a ticket and describe what the
   variable looks like.

   If you installed the starter kit to =~/.emacs.d/= then the
   directory =~/.emacs.d/src/org/doc= should be at the top of
   =Info-directory-list=. 
3) Did you =make= the manual?  Especially if you choose [[#no-compile][not to compile
   org-mode]], you may need to compile the documentation. Regardless of
   whether or not you compiled org, it may be helpful to try this
   solution out before opening a ticket.

   Navigate to the =src/org= directory of the starter kit. At the
   command prompt, type
   #+begin_src shell-script
     make info
     make install-info
   #+end_src
   where the last step is optional, and only required if you want to
   update the site-wide documentation of org-mode.

   To check if this fixed the issue, first close any Info buffers in
   emacs and call the Info index with =C-h i= then choose org-mode.

[2] The emacs starter kit uses [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] to load embedded elisp code
directly from [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] documents.
